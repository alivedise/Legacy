__steal__ is a function that loads scripts, css, and  other resources into your application.
 
	steal(FILE_or_FUNCTION, ...)
 
## Quick Walkthrough
 
Add a script tag that loads<code>steal/steal.js</code> and add the path to the first file to load in the query string like:
 
 &lt;script type='text/javascript'
     src='../steal/steal.js?myapp/myapp.js'>
 &lt;/script>
 
Then, start loading things and using them like:
 
     steal('myapp/tabs.js',
           'myapp/slider.js', 
           'myapp/style.css',function(){
     
        // tabs and slider have loaded 
        $('#tabs').tabs();
        $('#slider').slider()
     })
 
Make sure your widgets load their dependencies too:
 
     // myapp/tabs.js
     steal('jquery', function(){
       $.fn.tabs = function(){
        ...
       }
     })
 
## Examples:
 
     // Loads ROOT/jquery/controller/controller.js
     steal('jquery/controller')
     steal('jquery/controller/controller.js')
     
     // Loads coffee script type and a coffee file relative to
     // the current file
     steal('steal/coffee').then('./mycoffee.coffee')
     
     // Load 2 files and dependencies in parallel and
     // callback when both have completed
     steal('jquery/controller','jquery/model', function(){
       // $.Controller and $.Model are available
     })
     
     // Loads a coffee script with a non-standard extension (cf)
     // relative to the current page and instructs the build
     // system to not package it (but it will still be loaded).
     steal({
        src: "./foo.cf",
        packaged: false,
        type: "coffee"
      })
 
The following is a longer walkthrough of how to install
 and use steal:
 
## Adding steal to a page
 
After installing StealJS (or JavaScriptMVC), 
find the <code>steal</code> folder with
 <code>steal/steal.js</code>. 
 
To use steal, add a script tag
to <code>steal/steal.js</code> to your
html pages.  
 
This walkthrough assumes you have the steal script in <code>public/steal/steal.js</code> and a directory structure like:
 
 @codestart text
 /public
     /steal
     /pages
         myapp.html
     /myapp
         myapp.js
         jquery.js
         jquery.ui.tabs.js
 @codeend
 
 To use steal in <code>public/pages/myapp.html</code>,
 add a script tag in <code>myapp.html</code>:
 
 @codestart html
 &lt;script type='text/javascript'
     src='../steal/steal.js'>
 &lt;/script>
 @codeend
 
 <div class='whisper'>PRO TIP: Bottom load your scripts. It
 will increase your application's percieved response time.</div>
 
## Loading the First Script
 
 Once steal has been added to your page, it's time
 to load scripts. We want to load <code>myapp.js</code>
 and have it load <code>jquery.js</code> and 
 <code>jquery.ui.tabs.js</code>.
 
 By default, steal likes your scripts
 to be within in the [steal.static.root steal.root] folder.  The [steal.root] the 
 folder contains the <code>steal</code> folder.  In this example,
 it is the <code>public</code> folder.
 
 To load <code>myapp/myapp.js</code>, we have two options:
 
#### Add a script tag
  
 Add a script tag after the steal 
 script that 'steals' <code>myapp.js</code> like:
 
 @codestart html
 &lt;script type='text/javascript'>
   steal('myapp/myapp.js')
 &lt;/script>
 @codeend
 
#### Add the script parameter
 
 The most common (and shortest) way to load <code>myapp.js</code>
 is to add the script path to the steal script's src after in the
 query params.  So, instead of adding a script, we change 
 the steal script from:
 
 @codestart html
 &lt;script type='text/javascript'
     src='../steal/steal.js'>
 &lt;/script>
 @codeend
 
 To
 
 @codestart html
 &lt;script type='text/javascript'
     src='../steal/steal.js?<b>myapp/myapp.js</b>'>
 &lt;/script>
 @codeend
 
 <div class='whisper'>PRO TIP: You can also just add
 <code>?myapp</code> to the query string.</div>
 
## Loading Scripts
 
 We want to load <code>jquery.js</code> and
 <code>jquery.ui.tabs.js</code> into the page and then
 add then create a tabs widget.  First we need to load 
 <code>jquery.js</code>.
 
 By default, steal loads script relative to [steal.root]. To
 load <code>myapp/jquery.js</code> we can the following to
 <code>myapp.js</code>:
 
     steal('myapp/jquery.js');
     
 But, we can also load relative to <code>myapp.js</code> like:
 
     steal('./jquery.js');
     
 Next, we need to load <code>jquery.ui.tabs.js</code>.  You
 might expect something like:
 
     steal('./jquery.js','./jquery.ui.tabs.js')
 
 to work.  But there are two problems / complications:
 
   - steal loads scripts in parallel and runs out of order
   - <code>jquery.ui.tabs.js</code> depends on jQuery being loaded
   
 This means that steal might load <code>jquery.ui.tabs.js</code>
 before <code>jquery.js</code>.  But this is easily fixed.
 
 [steal.static.then] waits until all previous scripts have loaded and
 run before loading scripts after it.  We can load <code>jquery.ui.tabs.js</code>
 after <code>jquery.js</code> like:
 
     steal('./jquery.js').then('./jquery.ui.tabs.js')
 
 Finally, we need to add tabs to the page after 
 the tabs's widget has loaded.  We can add a callback function to
 steal that will get called when all previous scripts have finished
 loading:
 
     steal('./jquery.js').then('./jquery.ui.tabs.js', function($){
       $('#tabs').tabs();
     })

## Other Info
 
### Exclude Code Blocks From Production

 To exclude code blocks from being included in 
 production builds, add the following around
 the code blocks.

     //!steal-remove-start
         code to be removed at build
     //!steal-remove-end
 
### Lookup Paths
 
 By default steal loads resources relative 
 to [steal.static.root steal.root].  For example, the following
 loads foo.js in <code>steal.root</code>:
 
     steal('foo.js'); // loads //foo.js
     
 This is the same as writing:
 
     steal('//foo.js');
     
 Steal uses <code>'//'</code> to designate the [steal.static.root steal.root]
 folder.
 
 To load relative to the current file, add <code>"./"</code> or
  <code>"../"</code>:
  
     steal("./bar.js","../folder/zed.js");
 
 Often, scripts can be found in a folder within the same 
 name. For example, [jQuery.Controller $.Controller] is 
 in <code>//jquery/controller/controller.js</code>. For convience,
 if steal is provided a path without an extension like:
 
     steal('FOLDER/PLUGIN');
     
 It is the same as writing:
 
     steal('FOLDER/PLUGIN/PLUGIN.js')
     
 This means that <code>//jquery/controller/controller.js</code>
 can be loaded like:
 
      steal('jquery/controller')
 
### Types
 
 steal can load resources other than JavaScript.
 
 
 @constructor
 
 Loads resources specified by each argument.  By default, resources
 are loaded in parallel and run in any order.
 
 
 @param {String|Function|Object} resource... 
 
 Each argument specifies a resource.  Resources can 
 be given as a:
 
### Object
  
 An object that specifies the loading and build 
 behavior of a resource.  
    
      steal({
        src: "myfile.cf",
        type: "coffee",
        packaged: true,
        unique: true,
        ignore: false,
        waits: false
      })
    
 The available options are:
    
  - __src__ {*String*} - the path to the resource.  
    
  - __waits__ {*Boolean default=false*} - true the resource should wait 
    for prior steals to load and run. False if the resource should load and run in
    parallel.  This defaults to true for functions.
  
  - __unique__ {*Boolean default=true*} - true if this is a unique resource 
    that 'owns' this url.  This is true for files, false for functions.
             
  - __ignore__ {*Boolean default=false*} - true if this resource should
    not be built into a production file and not loaded in
    production.  This is great for script that should only be available
    in development mode.
  
  - __packaged__ {*Boolean default=true*} - true if the script should be built
    into the production file. false if the script should not be built
    into the production file, but still loaded.  This is useful for 
    loading 'packages'.
 
  - __type__ {*String default="js"*} - the type of the resource.  This 
    is typically inferred from the src.
 
### __String__
  
 Specifies src of the resource.  For example:
  
       steal('./file.js')
         
 Is the same as calling:
      
       steal({src: './file.js'})
  
### __Function__ 
  
 A callback function that runs when all previous steals
 have completed.
    
     steal('jquery', 'foo',function(){
       // jquery and foo have finished loading
       // and runing
     })
 
 @return {steal} the steal object for chaining
